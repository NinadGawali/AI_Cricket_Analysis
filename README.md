# AI Cricket Analysis ‚Äî `cricket_data` Module

This repository is part of the broader **AI Cricket Analysis** project and serves as the core data module. It contains all raw and processed cricket datasets under the `cricket_data` folder, along with the necessary scripts for data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.


## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of the **AI Cricket Analysis** project is to apply data science, machine learning, and statistical modeling to cricket match data to derive deep insights, make robust predictions, and visualize performance trends.

The **`cricket_data`** module specifically handles:
* **Data Ingestion:** Parsing and loading raw match data (JSON, CSV, YAML).
* **Data Preparation:** Splitting and filtering datasets to create input-ready files for downstream modeling.
* **NLP Based SQL Querry Agent:** The User can querry information stored in the Sqlite database easily using Natural Language which is then executed by the Agent.
